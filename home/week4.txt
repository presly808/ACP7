1. Multithreading

        Lifecycle of threads
        synchronized blocks and methods
        Threads synchronization(wait, notify, notifyAll)

2. Write own scheduler task
   That helps to run some task periodically

3. Implement search in file system without recursion (use queue)

4. Implement search in file system using (Threads): ThreadPool -> ExecutorService + Callable

5. Implement multithreading search in file system using Producer-Consumer pattern

    3,4,5 - (file paths which have been found, save into one file results.txt)



6. Write synchronous chat between two machines (use ServerSocket and Socket)

7. Write universal downloader from ex.ua (That helps us download all files from page)
              1. First input url address of page
              2. then parse page and find urls like "/load/{idOfFile}" ex. href="/load/124701188"
              3. Take url and download file using URL class

8*. Implement asynchronous chat that allows communication with two and more users
        Must have
        - (saving history of messages into the file)
        - read connections setting(port, max users size, list of banned users)
            from server_settings.properties (see class Properties)
        - send message using Serialization (ObjectOutputStream, ObjectInputStream)
        - for better architecture of application see pattern Observer
        - * write UI based on Swing
